# Hi, I'm a fellow human & designer!

I love designing interactions between humans with humans, & “bots”. Over the last 3 years I have created human friendly physical/digital experiences, by doing interaction design for a sound emoji application; design strategy for a budgeting tool for freelancers; interaction & service design for cultural-culinary curiosity; & social innovation & user experience design for improving healthcare in India.
